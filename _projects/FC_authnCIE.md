The Italian Electronic Identity Card (CIE 3.0) allows citizens to authenticate securely to online services of institutions and public administrations. The objective of this project is to update eIDAS-notified scenarios with security assessment of the newly implemented functionalities (e.g., analysis of the TLS configuration, OWASP analysis of the CIE Id app) and design of possible evolutions (e.g., multiple CIE support on the same device, PUK Recovery).
